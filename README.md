#### Data File(s)

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

#### Install the Dotnet Core SDK
Before starting, check to see if you already have the .NET 7.0 SDK already installed by entering this command:

`dotnet --list-sdks`

If the .NET 7.0 SDK is already installed, you should see it in the following list:

![alt text](/screenshots/dotnet_output.PNG)

As long as the above list contains version `7.0.xxx` (underlined in red), then you can skip to the next step. If your list does not contain version 7.0, or you get any kind of error message, then you will need to download and install the .NET 7.0 SDK.

To download, run the following commands to add the Microsoft package signing key to your list of trusted keys and add the package repository.

```
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb
```

Next, you can now run this command to install the .NET 7.0 SDK:

```
sudo apt-get update && \
  sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-7.0
```

Once all of this is done, you should be able to verify that the SDK is installed with the `dotnet --list-sdks` command.

----------------------------------------

#### Download this project
```
$ git clone https://github.com/MelissaData/EmailObject-Dotnet-Linux
$ cd EmailObject-Dotnet-Linux
```

#### Set up Melissa Updater 
Melissa Updater is a CLI application allowing the user to update their Melissa applications/data. 

- In the root directory of the project, create a folder called `MelissaUpdater` by using the command: 

  `mkdir MelissaUpdater`

- Enter the newly created folder using the command:

  `cd MelissaUpdater`

- Proceed to install the Melissa Updater using the curl command: 

  `curl -L -O https://releases.melissadata.net/Download/Library/LINUX/NET/ANY/latest/MelissaUpdater`

- After the Melissa Updater is installed, you will need to change the Melissa Updater to an executable using the command:

  `chmod +x MelissaUpdater`

- Now that the Melissa Updater is set up, you can now proceed to move back into the project folder by using the command:
  
   `cd ..`
----------------------------------------

#### Different ways to get data file(s)
1.  Using Melissa Updater
    - It will handle all of the data download/path and .so file(s) for you. 
2.  If you already have the latest DQS release zip, you can find the data file(s) in there
    - To pass in your own data file path directory, you may either use the '--dataPath' parameter or enter the data file path directly in interactive mode.
    - Comment out this line "DownloadDataFiles $license" in the bash script.
    - This will prevent you from having to redownload all the files.

#### Change Bash Script Permissions
To be able to run the bash script, you must first make it an executable using the command:

`chmod +x MelissaEmailObjectLinuxDotnet.sh`

As an indicator, the filename will change colors once it becomes an executable.

## Run Bash Script
Parameters:
- --email: a test email address
 	
  This is convenient when you want to get results for a specific email address in one run instead of testing multiple email addresses in interactive mode.  

- --dataPath (optional): a data file path directory to test the Email Object
- --license (optional): a license string to test the Email Object

- --quiet (optional): add to the command if you do not want to get any console output from the Melissa Updater

When you have modified the script to match your data location, let's run the script. There are two modes:
- Interactive 

	The script will prompt the user for an email address, then use the provided email to test Email Object. For example:
	```
	$ ./MelissaEmailObjectLinuxDotnet.sh
	```
  For quiet mode:
  ```
  $ ./MelissaEmailObjectLinuxDotnet.sh --quiet
  ```
- Command Line 

	You can pass an email address in ```--email``` parameter and a license string in ```--license``` parameter to test Email Object. For example:
  ```
  $ ./MelissaEmailObjectLinuxDotnet.sh --email "info@melissa.com"
  $ ./MelissaEmailObjectLinuxDotnet.sh --email "info@melissa.com" --license "<your_license_string>"
  ```
	For quiet mode:
  ```
  $ ./MelissaEmailObjectLinuxDotnet.sh --email "info@melissa.com" --quiet
  $ ./MelissaEmailObjectLinuxDotnet.sh --email "info@melissa.com" --license "<your_license_string>" --quiet
  ```
This is the expected output from a successful setup for interactive mode:
